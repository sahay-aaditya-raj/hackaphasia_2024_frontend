      "paragraph": "In a small village nestled between green hills, a young girl named Aanya loved to spend her days exploring the forest nearby. The forest was full of tall trees, chirping birds, and colorful butterflies. One day, while walking along a narrow trail, Aanya found a small, injured bird lying on the ground. Carefully, she carried the bird home and took care of it. She named it 'Chirpy' and made a cozy nest for it in a basket. Over the next few weeks, Chirpy grew stronger and began to fly again. Aanya felt happy and proud when she saw Chirpy soaring in the sky. She realized that kindness and patience could make a big difference, even for the smallest creatures.",
